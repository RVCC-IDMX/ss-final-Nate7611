# Final Project
This is my final project for Web Dev 2 when I take a website and overhaul it with only css. I am not able to edit the html and the website has to follow the [Guidelines](https://stylestage.dev/guidelines/) and the [accessibility standards](https://stylestage.dev/resources/). I used my own style tile for the color theme and typography. 


## Checklist
I
* used ideas from my style tile
* used a reset/normalize library
* used my mobile-first assignment as my starting point
* used custom properties
* used fluid sizing
* used typography effects
* styled the background
* styled the links
* styled the lists
* styled the block quote
* put hover on something
* used ::before
* used animation with prefers-reduced-motion considerations 
* used Lighthouse to check load times and to ensure there are no accessibility issues

## Starter Information
Below is the instructions for the starter page I edited.



## IDMX 11ty Sass Starter

The set of development scripts in this starter is configured to watch and compile a simple Sass structure using 11ty.

The code is located in the `src` folder and the page is created in the `public` folder.

The `settings.json` in the `.vscode` folder sets the `LiveServer` configuration to serve from the `public` folder and can be used to serve the built page.

The build process includes minifiying and autoprefixing of styles via the `postbuild` script, which runs automatically after a `build`.

## Installation

**`npm install`**

>Run this command once to install the needed node modules.

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> This script runs 11ty with hot reload and served at the url localhost:8080. It will reload whenever there are HTML or Sass changes.

**`npm run build`**
np
> This script does a production build and includes minified, autoprefixed CSS.

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting services such as Netlify.
